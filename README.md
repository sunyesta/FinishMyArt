# Finish My Art

> "No Art is ever finished, it just gets published"

Finish My Art is a Web forum to share your art with other fellow artists, whether it is complete or in development/progress.
Users can view each other’s art work and chip in ideas, either by leaving a comment or uploading their own edit to the art as feedback.
All images are to be uploaded/downloaded to the application, which connects to our Google Cloud Storage database.
Image editing is not supported on the pages, and needs to happen outside of the application.

Go to our home page at FinishMy.art , and check out the amazing work from talented artists located world wide.
